Write a python program to demonstrate the inheritance principle of OOP. Create a Student class that includes student’s basic information : Name, Reg no, Age, Gender, Branch, Sem. Define functions to read and display basic information. Create a new class StudentResultInfo that inherits from Student class. Derived class will include student’s total marks, percentage and grade. Display student’s basic information and result information using derived class.


Imagine you're writing a Content Management system - this system will store two types of documents.
PDFs (who created, description, file size)
Pictures (who created, description, image dimensions, file size)
Imagine you're now asked to add a few features:
Checking to see whether the file size is beyond a certain threshold.
Display the details of document.
Checking to see whether it's too high of dimension of picture.
Note: use inheritance concept to reduce length of code.


Create vehicle class with data member’s name, mileage and capacity and member function bus fare.  Create a Bus child class that inherits from the Vehicle class. The default fare charge of any vehicle is seating capacity * 100. If Vehicle is Bus instance, we need to add an extra 10% on full fare as a maintenance charge. So total fare for bus instance will become the final amount = total fare + 10% of the total fare.
Note: The bus seating capacity is 50.
